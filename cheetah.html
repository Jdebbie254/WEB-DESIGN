                        natural speed and agility. In fact, chhetahs are the fastest mammals on earth.They can accelerate from 
                    60 miles per hour in just per hour in just 3seconds. Unlike lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs
                can't roar- they can only purr.<br><br>These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa. They can be
            found in countries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa, and Niger.The IUCN classes cheetahs as vulnerable. This 
        This means that the species is at a high risk of extinction in the wild.There are just 6,517 mature cheeetahs left in the wild,
    and their population is decreasing. Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers. </p>
