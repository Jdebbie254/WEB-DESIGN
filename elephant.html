                <td><p>In Kenya, African savanna elephants, the largest land animals, are found in national parks and reserves, living in matriarchal herds, and play a vital role in the ecosystem, facing threats from poaching and human-wildlife conflict. <br>The biggest can be up to 7.5m long, 3.3m high at the shoulder, and 6 tonnes in weight. In Kenya, you can spot these magnificent creatures while on a wildlife safari in most of Kenya's National Parks and Reserves. African Elephants are matriarchal, meaning they live in female-led groups.</p></td>
