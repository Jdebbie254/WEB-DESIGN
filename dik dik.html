        <td><p>The Dik dik is a type of a dwarf antelop that lives in arid regionsof East Africa. They can live in such
            barren environments because they get water from the vegetation they eat. They also take cover in undergrowth
            to protect themselves from predators, including eagles and cats. There are four different types of Dik diks,
            but just two of them live in Kenya. They include; Guenther's dik dik, and kirk's dik dik. Kirk's is the largest
            dik dik, though it's still small in comparison to other antelopes. It stands at just 45centimetres(18 inches) tall
            and weighs only 7.2kgs. Guenther's dik dik is smaller but has a longer snout. The IUCN</p></td>
